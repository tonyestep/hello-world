# hello-world
If I ever learn how to use GitHub, I will put my Twitter-bot code here
My bot grabs one text message from a file containing many. It chooses one at random
Then it goes to a directory wherein are a bunch of pictures and chooses one that has been tweeted the lowest number of times
Then it grabs one or more hashtags from an SQL table that was created by the hash-harvester (described later),
picking one that has been tweeted the least times
finally it chooses one URL from a list in the code.
then it makes these into a tweet and sends it,
and waits for a specified interval before repeating the process
or if the max number has been reached, exits.
